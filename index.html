              Hello, I am Jeremiah Pope. I am 20 years old and working to become
              a full stack devolper. I graduated from Chanhassen Highschool in
              2021 where I spend all four years in the band, choir and football
              team. That was also the same year I joined the national guard.
              Since then I finished OSUT training, joined the 34th infantry
              division of the MNNG. For work life I have done a little bit of
              alot of different things but I have mainly spend my time working
              in the food industry and helping work at some of the schools near
              me. When not working I love to spend time both indoors and
              outdoors doing things like biking, fishing and hiking, aswell as
              playing video games and learning how to code.

              These are my two most recent projects the first being a basic JS
              application that generates passwords on given criteria and the
              second is the closest I have to a full stack application. It uses
              two API's and is meant for searching game titles and then giving
              more recomendations based on the search aswell as showing the
              reviews available for that game

            Summary | I am a hard-working logical thinker who puts a lot of
            effort into doing things right. I work well with others and do a
            great job in constructive criticism and revising. As someone who is
            willing to learn about nearly anything I am apt at going outside the
            norm and working through it.
